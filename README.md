# (Super Paste) PasteWithFolderStructure
Tool to Paste file(s) with maintaining folder structure

This Tool helps you overcome the problem many have faced similar to me.
I was working with my customer and the customer gives me suggestion to change the website design/functionality day by day. I was changing one or two of CSS/JS/HTML/JSON/Images out of 100's of files in the project. 

I want to give them the complete project to replace or ask them to replace the changed files one by one in various folders which is a tedious one.
So come up with this tool to minimize both my work and customer's work of either giving the complete package or to explain them to replace the files in exact path which is error prone

With this tool, I will copy the changed file(s), paste it in a location by maintaing the folder structure. Then give that as a patch to customer. Customer can easily paste it in the root folder without overlooking for the file location.

### 1. Checkout this attached SuperPaste.exe
    Move to any folder of your wish
